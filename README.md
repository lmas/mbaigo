# mbaigo
Base library or Go module used by all systems

The idea behind the mbaigo project has been to empower technicians to learn to deploy a system of systems within half a day and engineers to develop new applications within one day.

## Status: 
- the code implementation is in its early stages and not production ready.
- the source code of the security systems will become available when they are ready.

## Organization of the module
The mbaigo module consists of three packages:
- components, which models the structure of all systems,
- use cases, which models common behaviors of all systems,
- forms, which describes the content of information exchange.
